With an overall development budget of NOK43.8 billion (US$4.2 billion), the budget falls short (0.75%) of Norway's 1% ODA/GNI target.\n\\\nAccording to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the budget proposal for 2023 reflects economic pressures caused by the war in Ukraine. Defending the ODA shortfall, the government cited exceptionally high revenues from oil and gas. However, Anne Beathe Tvinnereim (Minister of International Development) stated that Norway will continue to increase its international development funding in future years to meet its 1% ODA/GNI target.\n\\\nIn order to provide for Ukrainian refugees in Norway, the Government allocated NOK1.6 billion (US$150 million) in the proposed budget for 2023. However, the following budget allocations were reduced:\n\\\n- Peace, security and global cooperation;\n- Humanitarian assistance;\n- Education and research;\n- UN development work; and\n- Norway's International Climate and Forest Initiative (NICFI).\n- The budget for regional grants also saw major changes, including the addition of a new regional grant line called 'Ukraine and neighboring countries.' NOK1.6 billion (US$150 million) of in-house refugee expenses will be classified as ODA in 2023. This is an increase of NOK1.1 billion (US$98 million) compared to the balanced budget in 2022, but far lower than the expenses estimated in the revised budget.\n\\\nIn the budget, Asia received an additional NOK34 million (US$3 million), though assistance to specific regions was not specified, and the Latin American region received an additional NOK4 million (US$327,000). The other regional grants received significant cuts: \n\\\nGrants to partner countries in Africa saw a decrease of NOK212 million (US$19 million), though cuts to specific regions in Africa were not specified;\nFunding to the Middle East and North Africa decreased by NOK175 million (US$16 million);\nThe budget for Europe and Central Asia decreased by NOK139 million (US$13 million); and\nAppropriations for Afghanistan decreased by NOK 30 million (US$2.7 million).\nThe draft budget elicited strong reactions from the Socialist Left, Christian Democratic, and Green parties. The three political parties argued that Norway's extraordinary income during a time when many are facing hardships from war and climate change should result in more funding for development assistance, not a reduction.\n\\\nSecretary General of Save the Children Birgitte Lange observed that the budget allocation to fighting poverty was historically low in the proposal. Lange argued that the shortfall comprised an act of bad faith, given the government's promises of reaching 1% ODA/GNI in the Hurdal platform. \n\\\nDagfinn H\u00f8ybr\u00e5ten from Church Aid agreed, predicting that the government's dramatically lowered ambitions will lead other high-income countries to follow suit. \n\n\n\n\n", "sources": [{"type": "press_release", "language": "norwegian", "name": "Press release - Ministry of Foreign Affairs (in Norwegian)", "link": "https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dokumenter/prop.-1-s-20222023/id2931090/"}, {"type": "press_release", "language": "norwegian", "name": "Press release - Ministry of Foreign Affairs (in Norwegian)", "link": "https://www.regjeringen.no/no/aktuelt/pm_budsjett2023/id2930556/"}, {"type": "news_article", "language": "norwegian", "name": " News article - Bistandsaktuelt (in Norwegian)", "link": "https://www.bistandsaktuelt.no/bistandsbudsjettet-statsbudsjettet/et-svik-mot-verdens-fattigste/320201"}, {"type": "news_article", "language": "english", "name": "News article - Devex ", "link": "https://www.devex.com/news/norway-proposes-cutting-aid-share-to-46-year-low-104158"}], "funders": [{"funder_profiles_id": {"name": "Norway"}}], "topics": [{"topics_id": {"name": "Climate"}}]}, {"title": "UK tax cuts cause market turmoil, signal challenges for ODA budget", "slug": "uk-tax-cuts-cause-market-turmoil-signal-challenges-oda-budget", "publish_date": "2022-10-03", "content": "The new UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Kwasi Kwarteng\u2019s \u201cfiscal event\u201d on September 23, 2022, saw the announcement of the largest cut in UK government tax revenues since 1972 with a package of \u00a345 billion (US$60.5 billion) in tax reductions.\n\\\nThe announcement followed an earlier commitment by Prime Minister Liz Truss to cap energy prices for consumers and businesses, which will cost billions of pounds.

In addition, the study analyses the drivers of increased global food prices, showing that trends toward crisis have emerged over the last two years and were accelerated by Russia\u2019s conflict escalation in February 2022. Currently, several countries are facing food price spikes, with more than 40 countries experiencing 15% food inflation.\u00a0\n\\\nRussia and Ukraine represent around 12% of calories exported worldwide, accounting for one-third of total wheat exports and more than half of global sunflower oil exports. The report highlights that in June 2022, global wheat production fell by 1.5 million tons, - linked particularly to the conflict in Ukraine due to blocked wheat exports from Ukrainian harbors, etc., as well as decreases in agricultural production due to the dry season in countries like France, Spain, and India. These factors are exposing the most fragile countries to food insecurity, particularly low- and middle-income countries in the Middle East and North Africa region, which imports half of its cereals from Russia and Ukraine and countries in Southern Asia and the remainder of countries in the African Union. These countries will face higher costs when replacing low-cost imports with new suppliers.\u00a0\n\\\nThe report states that the global food security impact of the escalated conflict in Ukraine will depend on three factors:\n\\\n1.  A drastic reduction in agricultural production and food exports from Russia and Ukraine;\n2.  A surge in global food prices, as well as the prices of crucial inputs for global supply chains, such as fertilizers and energy; and\n3.  The launch of restrictive measures such as export bans of agricultural products, in several countries such as Argentina, Egypt, Indonesia, Serbia, and Turkey that have begun implementing these policies.\u00a0\n\\\nFinally, the report discusses some policy measures that could be taken to mitigate and eradicate global food insecurity. While in the short-term it is crucial to support the most fragile countries with humanitarian food assistance, it is also essential to address the root causes of hunger by supporting financial investments that allow the creation of resilient, sustainable, and productive agri-food systems.\u00a0\u00a0\n\\\n[Report - CeSPI (in Italian)](https://www.parlamento.it/application/xmanager/projects/parlamento/file/repository/affariinternazionali/osservatorio/approfondimenti/PI0191.pdf)", "sources": [{"type": "report", "language": "italian", "name": "CeSPI", "link": "https://www.parlamento.it/application/xmanager/projects/parlamento/file/repository/affariinternazionali/osservatorio/approfondimenti/PI0191.pdf"}], "funders": [{"funder_profiles_id": {"name": "EUI"}}, {"funder_profiles_id": {"name": "Italy"}}], "topics": [{"topics_id": {"name": "Nutrition"}}]}, {"title": "Oxfam calls for improved global food systems amidst growing shortage", "slug": "oxfam-calls-improved-global-food-systems-amidst-growing-shortage", "publish_date": "2022-07-07", "content": "Oxfam Novib in the Netherlands responded to the new Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) report, \u201cState of Food Insecurity and Nutrition in the World 2022\u201d with a call for improved global food systems that address inequalities. \n\\\nThe FAO report states that 828 million people in 2021 suffered hunger, an increase of 150 million people since the COVID-19 pandemic began. This development is concerning as it indicates a global food system under increasing pressure due to conflicts, the COVID-19 pandemic, and intensifying climate change impacts rather than a lack of food. The response highlighted the FAO's report finding - while hundreds of millions of people are starving, the wealth of billionaires in the food sector reached astronomical heights, increasing by US$382 million in the last two years.\n\\\nThe global food system was extremely vulnerable, even before the war in Ukraine. The author highlighted that the world food system upholds inequality, impoverishes small-scale farmers, perpetuates hunger, and damages the climate. Oxfam called for a system in service of the planet and people, rather than large agri-industries.\n\\\nOxfam highlighted the need for financial support in the food sector, citing that only 17% of the total US$3.8 billion required by the UN for emergency response in the Sahel region has been financed. Similarly, only 15% has been committed to the almost US$7 billion required by the UN to fight the worst drought in 40 years in East Africa and support 28 million people with extreme hunger.\n\\\n[\nPress release \u2013 Oxfam Novib (in Dutch)](uhttps://www.oxfamnovib.nl/persberichten/reactie-oxfam-novib-op-nieuwe-cijfers-vn-wereldvoedselrapport-2022\n\\\n[Report - FAO](https://www.fao.org/publications/sofi/2022/en/)", "sources": [{"type": "press_release", "language": "dutch", "name": "Press release \u2013 Oxfam Novib (in Dutch)", "link": "https://www.oxfamnovib.nl/persberichten/reactie-oxfam-novib-op-nieuwe-cijfers-vn-wereldvoedselrapport-2022"}, {"type": "report", "language": "english", "name": "Report - FAO", "link": "https://www.fao.org/publications/sofi/2022/en/"}], "funders": [{"funder_profiles_id": {"name": "Netherlands"}}], "topics": [{"topics_id": {"name": "Global health R&D"}}, {"topics_id": {"name": "Global Health"}}, {"topics_id": {"name": "Nutrition"}}]}, {"title": "Netherlands announces additional US$216 million loan for Ukraine through IMF", "slug": "netherlands-announces-additional-us216-million-loan-ukraine-through-imf", "publish_date": "2022-07-06", "content": "**On July 5, 2022, at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Lugano, Switzerland, the Dutch Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation Liesje Schreinemacher announced that the Netherlands will lend the Ukrainian government an additional US$216 million through the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
