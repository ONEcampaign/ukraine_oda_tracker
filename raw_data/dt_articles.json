The government has approved 14 military support packages and is preparing further assistance, signaling a deep commitment to Ukraine; \n\n- *Modernizing development assistance*: Sweden's approach to development assistance is undergoing a modernization process, aimed at creating better living conditions for those affected by poverty and oppression. The new reform agenda for Swedish development assistance policy emphasizes the importance of market economies, investment, trade, and education in alleviating poverty and integrating developing countries into the global economy. The agenda is focused on clearer results and transparency in :ABBR[ODA]; \n\n- *Global health*: The government highlighted that global health remains an :ABBR[ODA] and foreign policy priority, particularly in :abbr[SRHR].
