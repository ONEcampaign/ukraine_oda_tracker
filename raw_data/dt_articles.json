In total, European countries received NOK9.1 billion (US$842 million) in funding. Of the total European allocation, the largest share of funding went to Ukraine and Moldova. The funding to Ukraine in 2023 stood at NOK7.9 billion (US$730 million).\\\n\\\nDevelopment assistance to the African continent increased by NOK2.5 billion (US$321 million), reaching a total of NOK10.2 billion (US$943 million). Africa remains the region receiving the most development assistance from Norway. The increase in funding to Africa is explained by long-term assistance to agriculture, fisheries, food security and emergency relief.\\\n\\\nDevelopment assistance to the Middle East increased by over NOK1 billion (US$92 million), reaching NOK3.8 billion (US$351 million) in 2023. The increase was almost exclusively in emergency assistance. Palestine was the second-largest recipient of Norwegian development assistance in 2023, receiving NOK1.2 billion (US$111 million). The majority of the funding was given as humanitarian assistance and emergency relief.\\\n\\\n*By partner,* multilateral organizations were the largest partner group for Norwegian :abbr[ODA], followed by :abbr[CSOs] and the public sector.

The :abbr[WFP] was the second-largest recipient with NOK2.4 billion (US$222 million), approximately half of which was earmarked for emergency relief. Overall, multilateral organizations were the dominant partner group for Norwegian health assistance, with over 80% being channeled through multilateral partners in 2023. \\\n\\\n*By sector*, emergency relief and multisectoral support saw the largest growth from 2022 to 2023, while there was a decrease in refugee expenses and earmarked assistance for education.\\\n\\\n:abbr[ODA] to agriculture, fisheries, and food security significantly increased from NOK3.9 billion (US$360 million) in 2022 to NOK6.4 billion (US$592 million) in 2023. Most of the increase of NOK2.5 billion (US$231 million) was funded by the one-time funding package for :abbr[LICs] particularly affected by Russia's war against Ukraine.\\\n\\\nTotal Norwegian :abbr[ODA] to health stood at NOK6.5 billion (US$601 million) in 2023, up from NOK6.3 billion (US$582 million) in 2022. This is significantly lower than in 2020 and 2021, when development assistance globally was influenced by the Covid-19 pandemic.\\\n\\\nBetween 2014 and 2023, health assistance slightly increased when measured in 2024 prices, from NOK4.7 billion (US$434 million) in 2014.

Of the earmarked health :abbr[ODA], totaling NOK3.5 billion (US$323 million) in 2023, 58% went to programs targeting :abbr[LICs] not geographically earmarked.

Multilateral organizations, an important partner group in Norwegian :abbr[SRHR] efforts, received 51% of the earmarked support in addition to the calculated core support, totaling 81% of :abbr[SRHR]  support. :abbr[UNFPA] was the largest individual partner and received nearly half of total :abbr[SRHR]  support.\n", "sources": [{"type": "news_article", "language": "norwegian", "name": "Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation", "link": "https://www.norad.no/globalassets/publikasjoner/publikasjoner-2024/tall-som-teller---statistikk-over-norsk-utviklingsbistand-i-2023.pdf"}], "funders": [{"funder_profiles_id": {"name": "Norway"}}], "topics": [{"topics_id": {"name": "Nutrition"}}, {"topics_id": {"name": "Education"}}, {"topics_id": {"name": "Agriculture"}}, {"topics_id": {"name": "Gender Equality"}}, {"topics_id": {"name": "Nutritious Food Systems"}}, {"topics_id": {"name": "Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health"}}, {"topics_id": {"name": "Family Planning"}}, {"topics_id": {"name": "International development"}}, {"topics_id": {"name": "Global Health"}}, {"topics_id": {"name": "Climate"}}]}, {"title": "US to provide US$190 million in energy, economic funding, US$60 million for agricultural assistance to Ukraine", "slug": "us-to-provide-us-190-million-in-energy-and-economic-assistance-to-ukraine-2024", "publish_date": "2024-05-03", "content": "**On May 3, 2024, :abbr[USAID] announced that it is providing US$190 million to Ukraine for energy assistance to build resilient, reliable, affordable and secure energy supplies to Ukraine.**\\\n\\\nThe program, titled *Securing Power, Advancing Resilience and Connectivity*, will provide critical technical and equipment over a five-year period.

The :abbr[IFS]{title=\"International Institute for Fiscal Studies\"} also suggested that could be achieved by putting aside a fixed share (10-20%) of the budget each year for these costs, or by the agreeing to allow the :ABBR[ODA] budget to rise beyond 0.5% :abbr[ODA/GNI] (to approximately 0.55- 0.6%) in exceptional circumstances. While either of these suggestions, or a combination of the two, would require rolling targets and adjustments to ensure that funding can be recouped or spent appropriately in the future, the :abbr[IFS]{title=\"International Institute for Fiscal Studies\"} stated that these strategies would enable more programs to be protected from in-year cuts due to unforeseen spending;  \n\n- Basing the :ABBR[ODA] budget is based on the national income of the previous year, with an allowance for expected economic growth.
