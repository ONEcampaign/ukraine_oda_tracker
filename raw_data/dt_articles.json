This has created :abbr[ODA] budget unpredictability, as the :abbr[UK] government has had to accurately forecast the cash size of the economy and then make in-year adjustments to ensure spending hits 0.5% :abbr[ODA/GNI] by the end of the year. The :abbr[IFS]{title=\"International Institute for Fiscal Studies\"} stated that these unpredictable calculations, added to the unpredictability of other :abbr[ODA] spending needs such as :abbr[IDRC], which in 2022 amounted to 1/3 of :abbr[UK] :ABBR[ODA], can make it difficult for the :abbr[UK] government to plan the :ABBR[ODA] spend :abbr[ODA] effectively.\\\n\\\nThe :abbr[IFS]{title=\"International Institute for Fiscal Studies\"} proposed three changes to improve the predictability of the :ABBR[UK] :ABBR[ODA] budget process, which included: \n\n- Establishing a :ABBR[ODA] reserve to respond to meet unexpected demands, such as :abbr[IDRC], or world events, such as the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The :abbr[IFS]{title=\"International Institute for Fiscal Studies\"} also suggested that could be achieved by putting aside a fixed share (10-20%) of the budget each year for these costs, or by the agreeing to allow the :ABBR[ODA] budget to rise beyond 0.5% :abbr[ODA/GNI] (to approximately 0.55- 0.6%) in exceptional circumstances. While either of these suggestions, or a combination of the two, would require rolling targets and adjustments to ensure that funding can be recouped or spent appropriately in the future, the :abbr[IFS]{title=\"International Institute for Fiscal Studies\"} stated that these strategies would enable more programs to be protected from in-year cuts due to unforeseen spending;  \n\n- Basing the :ABBR[ODA] budget is based on the national income of the previous year, with an allowance for expected economic growth. The :abbr[IFS]{title=\"International Institute for Fiscal Studies\"} noted that lagging calculations of the :ABBR[ODA] budget would avoid having to track and adjust :abbr[ODA] to in-year fluctuations of national income.  In the case of an economic crash, :abbr[ODA]cuts would first be made the following year, leaving adequate time to plan and adjust :abbr[ODA] programs; and\n\n- Performing fiscal tests that assess the possibility of returning to 0.7% :abbr[ODA/GNI] in the third year of an economic forecast. The :abbr[IFS]{title=\"International Institute for Fiscal Studies\"} suggested that the results would then be treated as a given and enable a gradual ramping up of spending over 3 years.
