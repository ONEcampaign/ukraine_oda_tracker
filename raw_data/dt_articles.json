The act denied individuals arriving in the :abbr[UK] through irregular or illegal routes the ability to apply for asylum. It gave the :abbr[UK] the right to return individuals to their home country or a third country where their asylum claim could be assessed.\\\n\\\n:abbr[ICAI] found that denying access to an asylum application entails that these individuals are not considered refugees under :abbr[UK] law, therefore, funds expended on them cannot be classified as in-donor refugee costs.\\\n\\\nIn 2022, the :abbr[UK] spent GBP3.7 billion (US$4.4 billion) of its :abbr[ODA] budget on in-donor refugee costs. The Home Office was responsible for GBP2.9 billion (US$3.5 billion) of these funds.\\\n\\\n:abbr[ICAI] created three scenarios for 2024 to evaluate at the impact of :abbr[ODA] spending on in-donor refugee costs.\n- Scenario 1 assumes the act is fully implemented, and the government does not create any new safe and legal routes. In-donor refugee costs would fall to just GBP222 million (US$266 million) in 2024;\n- Scenario 2 assumes the act is fully implemented, and the government sets up new safe and legal routes by expanding the :abbr[UK] Resettlement Scheme to take an additional 20,000 refugees per year. In-donor refugee costs would fall sharply to GBP394 million (US$472 million) in 2024; and\n- Scenario 3 assumes that the act is only partially implemented, applied only to some people arriving via illegal routes. In-donor refugee costs would remain high, standing at GBP1.8 billion (US$2.2 billion) in 2024, though this would still be below 2022 levels.\n\n<br>\n\n:abbr[ICAI] noted that the act would not affect people seeking protection through safe and legal routes via :abbr[UK] schemes such as its nationality-based schemes for Hong Kong and Ukraine and the more limited schemes for Afghanistan and Syria.
