The act denied individuals arriving in the :abbr[UK] through irregular or illegal routes the ability to apply for asylum. It gave the :abbr[UK] the right to return individuals to their home country or a third country where their asylum claim could be assessed.\\\n\\\n:abbr[ICAI] found that denying access to an asylum application entails that these individuals are not considered refugees under :abbr[UK] law, therefore, funds expended on them cannot be classified as in-donor refugee costs.\\\n\\\nIn 2022, the :abbr[UK] spent GBP3.7 billion (US$4.4 billion) of its :abbr[ODA] budget on in-donor refugee costs. The Home Office was responsible for GBP2.9 billion (US$3.5 billion) of these funds.\\\n\\\n:abbr[ICAI] created three scenarios for 2024 to evaluate at the impact of :abbr[ODA] spending on in-donor refugee costs.\n- Scenario 1 assumes the act is fully implemented, and the government does not create any new safe and legal routes. In-donor refugee costs would fall to just GBP222 million (US$266 million) in 2024;\n- Scenario 2 assumes the act is fully implemented, and the government sets up new safe and legal routes by expanding the :abbr[UK] Resettlement Scheme to take an additional 20,000 refugees per year. In-donor refugee costs would fall sharply to GBP394 million (US$472 million) in 2024; and\n- Scenario 3 assumes that the act is only partially implemented, applied only to some people arriving via illegal routes. In-donor refugee costs would remain high, standing at GBP1.8 billion (US$2.2 billion) in 2024, though this would still be below 2022 levels.\n\n<br>\n\n:abbr[ICAI] noted that the act would not affect people seeking protection through safe and legal routes via :abbr[UK] schemes such as its nationality-based schemes for Hong Kong and Ukraine and the more limited schemes for Afghanistan and Syria. Around 60% of the 500,000 people who have received some form of protection in the :abbr[UK] since 2015 arrived through safe and legal routes from Ukraine and Hong Kong. :abbr[ICAI] also noted, however, that the number of individuals coming from these two countries to the :abbr[UK] has significantly decreased in the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> quarters of 2023 and is likely to continue to decrease in the future.\\\n\\\nAn explanatory note accompanying the act mentioned the Prime Minister\u2019s promise to create more safe and legal routes for people seeking asylum in the :abbr[UK]. :abbr[ICAI] noted that the Prime Minister also stated that more safe and legal routes will only be implemented once the government has achieved sufficient control of :abbr[UK] borders.\\\n\\\n:abbr[ICAI] has not sought legal advice or input on the act.
